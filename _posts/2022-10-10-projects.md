# Projets

## Book Recommender System with ML

Book recommender system is an intelligent application that provides book recommendations to users based on their preferences and reading history. The system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze user behavior and identify their preferences. The main objective of this project is to develop a book recommender system that suggests books to users based on their interests, previous readings, and other factors like genre, author, rating, and publication date. The system will be built using Python programming language and will use a database to store user information and book data. The application will provide a user-friendly interface that allows users to rate books and provide feedback, which will further improve the recommendations. The project aims to help readers discover new books and authors, and encourage them to read more by providing personalized recommendations. The book recommender system will be evaluated based on its accuracy, speed, and user satisfaction.

### Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to help readers discover new books and authors that match their interests and reading preferences. In today's world, with the vast amount of books available, it can be challenging for readers to find new books that they might enjoy. Many readers end up sticking to their favorite authors or genres, which can limit their reading experiences.

The book recommender system aims to solve this problem by providing readers with personalized book recommendations based on their reading history, preferences, and behavior. The system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze user data and provide relevant recommendations.

By developing this book recommender system, we hope to encourage readers to explore new books and authors that they may not have discovered otherwise. We also aim to provide readers with a personalized reading experience that makes book discovery more accessible and enjoyable.

Overall, our motivation for developing this project is to promote a love for reading and help readers discover new books that they can enjoy.
